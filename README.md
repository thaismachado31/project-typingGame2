# type away....

A typing game that you have to type as many words as you can in 30 seconds.
The faster you are the more points you achieve and more difficult it becomes.

## Guidelines

- To start just press the `start typing` button and the first word apears
- Start typing and if the letter typed is corret it turns green in the screen, if you misspelled it, it goes automatically to the next word.
- Every 6 rounds it changes de word cattegory, starting with `3-letter words` going up to `10-letter words`
- Every 5 points you get extra 5 seconds to continue playing.
- An `alert sound` warns you when you are running out of time.
- When you get `game over` you can try again and maybe beat your last score by pressing the `start over` button
